    "The Panun Blog is a multimedia platform aimed at providing an inclusive forum for the people of Kashmir valley and beyond. Our vision is to facilitate a channel of healthy discourse and debate within the Kashmiri and non-Kashmiri communities. The idealistic tendency of humans to view the world as good or evil is a misinterpretation of reality. The outcomes of dialogue or the lessons to be learnt from our history cannot be distinctively categorized as being black or white. Look closely and youâ€™ll see a broad patchwork of different shades of grey. We at the Panun Blog, do not claim that one will find an objective truth in this greyish spectrum, but atleast negotiations within this realm is where we will find commonalities with our adversaries and strive passionately to gather the courage to put aside futile differences and coexist peacefully for the sake of our future generations.";

Here you will discover the unsung, blooming intellectuals of our time, who by the sheer power of their pen illuminate the dark corners of our world. Let the streets of the world echo the voices of the voiceless!";

We have partnered with various local, national and international stakeholders to ensure a multifaceted collaboration of talented and ambitious thinkers and writers from all around the world via this platform. A lot of pain and efforts have been utilised in its making, but most importantly our love and passion for Kashmir and its people has driven us to launch this platform keeping in mind the need for spreading the positivity and the energy of Keashur Kalam on the internet. It is the way of our founder to say thanks to what Kashmir has blessed him with, and do something worthwhile for his people.  ";
